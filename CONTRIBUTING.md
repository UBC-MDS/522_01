# Contributing to the Credit Approval Prediction

This outlines are indicated to know the credit card approving factors based on our dataset.

There is also a strict no meanness rule. At every step, please be kind and inclusive, even if people are asking not-so-informed questions.

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem. If you've found a
bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal 
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  
*  New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org) or PEP8 [style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
*  Pull requests should be reviewed by Friday end of day.
*  Any revisions should be communicated via GitHub issue or Slack (for urgent updates/notification).

### Final review and submission
*  The proof-reader will review the work on Saturday and ensure that the final version is ready for submission and create the required version tag.
*  Submit by Saturday at 6:00 pm.

### Breach of Contract

*   a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.
*   a meeting to discuss the behaviour and write an agreement to follow the team contract is required by the member.
*   to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs of the issues with the teammate
